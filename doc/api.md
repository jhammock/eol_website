# About the web services API

## Installation

To enable token authentication, one must add a single line to the
`config/secrets.yml` to set the `json_web_token_secret`.
In my own (JAR's) debugging setup I do this under the `development:`
section of the file by adding a line

    json_web_token_secret: e949a...

For other installations it might have to go under a different section.
I don't know how the key should be generated; I used a random
64-hex-digit string but maybe it doesn't have to be hex or so long.

Any change to this key will require 'power users' to get new tokens.

## Authorization

In order for you to be able to use the web services API, an EOL
administrator needs to do the following:

    rails r 'User.find_by_email("you@you.you").grant_power_user'

where you@you.you is the email address for your account on the EOL site. Please contact hammockj AT si.edu

## Getting a token

You need to get a token using the ordinary UI in the browser; later
you'll be able to do this from a script.  

The page to visit, after you log in, is called
`/services/authenticate` (preceded with `https://eol-beta.org` or
whatever the applicable EOL site happens to be).  Copy the token
(without the quotes) from the web browser into a file, so you can use
it in API calls.  Keep the token in a safe place; it is similar to a
password.

## Invoking API methods

The services are under `/service/`.  Currently the only service is `/service/cypher`.

Services are invoked using HTTP, either from a browser, using a
command line tool such as `curl` or `wget`, or a library such as
`requests` in python.

With each request, it is necessary to provide the token in an HTTP
`Authorization:` header, for example:

    Authorization: JWT eyJ0eXAzczOzJZUzZ1NzJ9.eyJ1c2VyZjoTA1QWJsZzfQ.Xf5FSA2P_lJBGyBYGTsRPczAkg

Don't forget to use `https:` instead of `http:`, to keep the token private.

If you store the token in a file, be sure to protect the file.  On any
Unix-like machine, you can do the following at the shell: (assume the
file is called `api.token`)

    chmod 600 api.token

## Example: Access from shell using wget

`wget` is a common shell utility, similar to `curl`, for doing HTTP
requests.  Suppose the API token is in a file called `api.token`.  The
following illustrates use of `wget` with the `cypher` service:

    wget -O cypher.out --header "Authorization: JWT `cat api.token`" \
      https://beta.eol.org/service/cypher?query="MATCH (n:Trait) RETURN n LIMIT 1;"

Or, if the Cypher query is in a file called `query.cypher`:

    wget -O cypher.out --header "Authorization: JWT `cat api.token`" \
      https://beta.eol.org/service/cypher?query="`cat query.cypher`"

These commands may only work from `bash`, which is the shell that I
use, and the standard shell on most GNU/Linux systems.


## Access from shell using curl

When submitting a query it's necessary to convert any spaces to `%20`.
This is not something you want to do manually.  `wget` does this
automatically, but `curl` does not, as far as I can tell.  So I
recommend you use `wget` instead of `curl`.


## Example: Access using python

Here is a simple python program that invokes the `/service/cypher` API
call.  The name of the file containins the token is given as a command
line argument, and the query is given as a second command line
argument, for example (typed at the shell):

    python cypher.py --tokenfile=api.token --query="MATCH (n:Trait) RETURN n LIMIT 1;"

where [`cypher.py`](cypher.py) is the file containing the following Python script:

```
import requests, argparse, json, sys

default_server = "https://beta.eol.org"
sample_data = {"a": "has space", "b": "has %", "c": "has &"}

def doit(tokenfile, server, query):
    with open(tokenfile, 'r') as infile:
        api_token = infile.read().strip()
    url = "%s/service/cypher" % server.rstrip('/')
    data = {"query": query}
    r = requests.get(url,
                    headers={"accept": "application/json",
                             "authorization": "JWT " + api_token},
                    params=data)
    if r.status_code != 200:
        sys.stderr.write('HTTP status %s\n' % r.status_code)
    json.dump(r.json(), sys.stdout, indent=2, sort_keys=True)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--tokenfile', help='file containing bare API token', default=None)
    parser.add_argument('--query', help='cypher query to run', default=None)
    parser.add_argument('--server', help='URL for EOL web app server', default=default_server)
    args=parser.parse_args()
    doit(args.tokenfile, args.server, args.query)
```

*Warning:* The beta.eol.org site uses TLS1.2 for connection privacy
(`https:`).  This version of TLS seems to be not fully supported in
the version of Python that is built in to MacOS 10.12 (Sierra), and
may be absent from tools of similar vintage.  If the example fails
with an SSL error, make sure you have an up to date version of openssl
(1.0.1 works, at least) and a Python that uses it.  I find this a bit
confusing since TLS 1.2 was published in 2008, but I am just relaying
my experience.

## Example: access from a web form

Put the following in a file with extension `.html`, and open it in a browser

```
<h1>Cypher query</h1>
<form action='https://beta.eol.org/service/cypher'>
  <textarea name='query' id='query' cols='50' rows='5'>MATCH (n:Trait) RETURN n LIMIT 1;</textarea>
  <input type='submit' />
</form>
```


## Example query: show traits

The following Cypher query shows basic information recorded in an
arbitrarily chosen set of Trait nodes.

```
MATCH (t:Trait)<-[:trait]-(p:Page),
      (t)-[:supplier]->(r:Resource),
      (t)-[:predicate]->(pred:Term)
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:object_term]->(obj:Term)
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:normal_units_term]->(units:Term)
OPTIONAL MATCH (lit:Term) WHERE lit.uri = t.literal
RETURN r.resource_id, t.eol_pk, t.resource_ok, t.source, p.page_id, t.scientific_name, pred.uri, pred.name,
       t.object_page_id, obj.uri, obj.name, t.normal_measurement, units.uri, units.name, t.normal_units, t.literal, lit.name
LIMIT 5
```
